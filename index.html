       <h2>Project Dark Dreams</h2>

       <h3>Duration completed: 1 week </h3>
       <h3>[ process analysis ]</h3>
       <p class="p1">This project was for IAT233 spreadsheet design, we were assigned to create 3 spreadsheets with implementing the spatial design. The goal for this assignment was to train the ability to manage the space between elements, (elements such as images, text, headers, shapes  or other design elements.) This project was individual and the photos were required to be taken by ourselves and had to be black and white. The entire process of the photoshoot was, First, picking the best photo shooting location, which was in downtown Vancouver, after that, I had to set the camera and set the correct aperture, IOS etc. After the photoshoot, there was a need for using Adobe photoshop to brush away useless background(people, lights, other objects, etc.) and used Adobe Lightroom to adjust the Saturation. The spreadsheets were done by using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>This project is an individual project, the entire process was completed by myself. The challenges of this project were taking the photos which would match the content at the same time manage the design spacing with the content and image in the spreadsheet.</p>

      <h2>Game Design - Smash</h2>



      <h3>[ process analysis ]</h3>

      <h3>Duration completed: 3 weeks </h3>
      <p class="p1">This is a game I created in IAT167 using processing. The goal of this project is to train students the skill of java in processing, by using gifs and self-drawn images, creating a game. The character can fully move on the screen and attack enemies. There are 3 levels in total and the difficulty increases as the user reaches the next level, there will be a final boss at the 3rd level. This game took approximately 1 month to create. The game creation was broken into 3 milestones. First off starting with sketching the idea and marking down the class that will be needed for the game, next was to implement each of the methods into Processing. Finally, combining images that have micro animations into a gif and implementing them into the game. There was also sound effect added and before it was due, there was a report to summarize all the features and methods for the game. What was challenging for the game was the stage designs and the actual coding, it wasn't just simply design a game but certain their toys were required to be implemented through the creation of the game? Through the process of coding, the controlling of the animation gifs, which were several images loaded and looped by using code, was difficult to toggle functionally with the keyboard controls (left-right, up, down etc.) </p>

      <p>This assignment was an individual assignment. I was responsive to the entire process. Which includes the brief milestone introduction, the coding process, image creating (health bar, life potion etc.) also the mockup which is displayed on the portfolio.</p>
